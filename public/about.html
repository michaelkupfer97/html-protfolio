<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

I’m Michael Kupfer, a final-year Computer Science student at SCE (Sami Shamoon College of Engineering) with a strong focus on AI, data science, and modern software engineering. My background bridges both theory and practice — from building compilers and parallel algorithms to applying deep learning and graph neural networks to real-world engineering problems like automated truss design in civil engineering.

Most of my coding is in Python (AI/ML, data pipelines, backend services), but I also work with Java and C++ for system-level and performance-critical projects. On the web side, I’ve built full-stack applications with JavaScript/React and Node.js, combining robust backend logic with intuitive frontends.

Beyond academics, I’m entrepreneurial and data-driven — I actively track financial markets, run personal projects (like stock analytics dashboards with ML models), and constantly look for opportunities to blend technology with real business impact. I enjoy working in collaborative, high-energy teams, and I thrive when I’m challenged to solve complex problems at scale.

My long-term goal is to grow into advanced software engineering and AI roles in high-tech, starting with strong foundations as a Full-Stack / Backend Engineer while keeping my passion for ML and data at the center of my career.</p>
